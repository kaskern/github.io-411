                         Every 15–20 years mythological creatures become dormant and slumber well into the nights until they are rested to wreak havoc again. There has not been any creatures in the last 50 years because of the residents not appreciating the natural world. It is said that the creatures bless and cultivate the nature in order to support the humans, but there are others that are monstrous and devious and prey on humans. While in the past the tribes had kept those in check with few members being lost to the fowl folk, some feared all of them and stopped supporting them, so all have not been back. In prior history the townsfolk would bring offerings to the spirits of woodland myth in the town’s temple of Ulm, but that has become taboo, with only the towns seniles participating. Some say the very religion that the elders follow was developed all the way out of town to the plain-hilled coast were stone and ruin is lay formed.
