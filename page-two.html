                          Arabella was a child born from the Khan family. Named after the warrior goddess Ara, she grew up under the house hold of a famous hunter Arturo, meaning as strong as a bear. In the household was also her motherâ€™sfather Callahan, meaning lover of churches, andrightly so. He grew up in a time with crawling myths and legends and would often pray and bring offers to the temple of Ulm, but that became out of style and only for the senile folk who continued to pray for something that would never come. Her mother had a pair of boots that she would wear to work and while hunting. Over the years, long since her mother died, Arabella would faintly remember her mothers relaxed and carefree spirit pushing through the muddy soil. Upon searching her house for her families cloak, she stubbled upon the the worn, flaking-leathered boots with the pulled, stitch embroidered 15 point start on the heal. She stared at them long and hard. Memories from a childhood long gone, and tried on the boots. She would not wear another boot again.
