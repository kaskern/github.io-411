                          She walked down to the harbor where the waves came rolling in and noticed the smell had become strong and pungent. She looked to the bay where the houses had lit their lanterns to warm the stormy night. She then was struck by another large wind that shocked her to her core almost as if her mind was slammed right back into her body. Her fingers ached, and her stomach roiled. Then out of nowhere a large tentacle flung out of the water frightening her so hard that she screamed and put her hands in front of her. And when she put her hands out in front of her a large flash and growth of peach light brightened her face and the surrounding rocks and bay. She was panicked; it had happened so fast. Her shock must have combined with the sea monster because it did not show itself again. She looked back down at her hand and it was almost as if nothing had happened. Her body felt normal and her stomach felt full. She was confused. Was what just happened a dream? Where was her grandfather? Was this storm going to drop rain? Had she had enough water today? What was that?!?
