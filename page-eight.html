                          Just before she went to kneel at the altar the sound of windy screams enveloped her. The candles went out and her grandfather went silent. She stood up instantly pulling out her trusty pocketknife. The front door of the temple burst open by a gust of wind. Before she could decide what to do, she noticed her grandfather was missing. Did he know this place so well he could just run to the door in the pitch blackness? He clearly wasn't there, so she went out to see just what type of storm awaited and where her grandfather went. She often knew that in storms he would go down to the port to watch storms roll in over the waves.
