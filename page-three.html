                          The town and its people did not have many beliefs. The old religion was being kept alive by a string. No one cared to pray for something that wouldnâ€™t come; the world was just the way it was. The townsfolk did however still celebrate the peculiar solar occurrences and participate in the hunts and dog competitions. They all still knew the constellation in the sky, and the myth of the champion dog Cu waging war along the towns ancestors.
