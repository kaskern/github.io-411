                         Once every 15 years a pack of dogs is assembled by each tribe. Each tribe chooses a dog for their pack to participate in a large hunt. The hunt is dangerous and include wild bores and spirits of woodland myth. Only the strong survive. Once the trial is over each dog that remains is given to each tribeâ€™s household to protect the family. Myth of the culture believe dogs are the protectors of the people and the forest. A famous dog Cu was once gifted for its loyalty from one of the great gods. In battle he would grow 5x his normal size and was granted immunity in battle until his old age. Legend says his dog slobber could heal the worst of wounds. Every 15 years, the blanks await to see if in the upcoming year the great god will grant them another Cu.
