                          It had taken her an hour to get from the port to her house. Her legs ached from the stretch, and her mind drowned in thoughts. She was just about up the steps to the front porch when she noticed the cloak that hung by the window was gone meaning her father was gone as well, out on the hunt at least. She should have realized that he would be out late in the night exploring the forested hills to rile up wild boars for the upcoming celbratory hunt, but again this day was weird. It wasn't entirely her fault to have forgotten. While she waited for her father well into the night, she heard a faint barking in the distance. She decided to investigate, and as she was about to put on her boots, the barking became louder and panicked. What was her dog doing alone and not on the preliminary hunt?
